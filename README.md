# StyleTransfer
This is a notebook and module as an example in NN Style Transfer using VGG19 created from previously existing code.

I wanted to start digging into this but I would not have gotten anywhere without code and thought assistance from:
https://markojerkic.com/tensorflow-style-transfer/

You might get more from that link above.

To use this you can create a tensorflow environment in anaconda:

This also uses CV2 (open-cv) over scipy image reading and writing and numpy.
The utilities need matplotlib.pyplot as plt.
